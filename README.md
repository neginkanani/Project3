# Project 3 It's Five o'clock somewhere

Introducing our latest project - an interactive website designed exclusively for beer enthusiasts all around the world! Our mission is simple - to provide our users with an extensive and detailed analysis of the world of brews. We'll be gathering data on various breweries across the globe, including their location, size, and the types of beer they produce.

Our website will offer an innovative approach to exploring the world of beer by allowing users to search for breweries within a set radius of any location they choose. With a Geojson map and radius markers, our website provides the perfect platform for beer lovers to find their next favorite spot. And, with toggle options for defining radius and brewery types, users can easily filter their search results to find exactly what they're looking for. Our website also offers a unique feature where users can view and explore breweries worldwide.

And, of course, if there is time, we'll dive deep into the data to uncover any patterns or trends emerging in the beer industry. So whether you're a seasoned beer enthusiast or just getting started, our interactive website is the ultimate guide to exploring the world of brews. Cheers!

Our data is coming from the following websites:
